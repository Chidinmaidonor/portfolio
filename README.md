## Projects
### **üõ£Ô∏è A Basic PLC Traffic Controller Using TIA Portal** 
[GitHub Repo ¬ª](/https://github.com/Chidinmaidonor/PLC-Project-Traffic-Light-Control-System-without-HMI-in-Siemens-TIA-Portal.git)

This project demonstrates the development of a basic PLC-based traffic light control system using Siemens TIA Portal. Designed as a foundational automation project, it simulates real-world traffic signal operations by controlling red, yellow, and green lights in a sequential and timed manner.
üîß Key Features include - Implementation of ladder logic to simulate timed traffic light control for single or multi-lane intersections, with support for emergency overrides. Designed for simulation or deployment on Siemens S7-1200 PLCs.

### Ac to Ac Diode Bridge Rectifier
[The University of Tulsa- EEE Projects](/projects/university_of_tulsa/Chidinma_Idonor_P.E_Midterm_Project_Report.pdf)

Developed a systematic approach to evaluating AC‚ÄìDC conversion topologies by comparing circuit configurations and analyzing current waveforms using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This method enabled precise quantification of harmonic distortion and demonstrated the effectiveness of passive filtering components in improving power quality. The results offer a scalable, component-aware framework for optimizing conversion efficiency in diverse power electronic applications.

### Image Classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (University of Tulsa - Neural Network Midterm Project)
[The University of Tulsa- EEE Projects](/projects/university_of_tulsa/Chidinma_Idonor_Neural_Network_Midterm_Project_Report.pdf)

Designed and optimized a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset across ten object categories. Implemented advanced regularization techniques‚Äîincluding dropout, data augmentation, and batch normalization‚Äîto mitigate overfitting and improve generalization. Iterative architecture tuning and hyperparameter refinement led to a significant boost in validation accuracy, demonstrating practical expertise in deep learning model development and evaluation.
