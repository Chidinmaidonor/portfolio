# 🤖 Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my **AI & Machine Learning portfolio**.  
Here, I showcase projects where I applied **data science, neural networks, deep learning, and MLOps practices** to solve real-world problems.  

My focus areas include:  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** → Regression, Classification, Clustering  
- 🎨 **Computer Vision** → Image recognition, Object detection  
- 🗣️ **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** → Text classification, Chatbots  
- ☁️ **MLOps & Deployment** → CI/CD pipelines, Model serving on cloud platforms
